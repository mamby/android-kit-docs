AndroidKit owns typography, shapes, component padding/spacing, icon/control sizes,
border widths and shadow geometry. Hosts configure the color scheme, light/dark
identity, floating-surface transparency and explicit component color roles.

```kotlin
val definition = AndroidKitThemeDefinition(
    colorScheme = appColors,
    isDark = darkTheme,
    floatingSurfaceOpacityLevel = savedTransparency,
    floatingSurfaceColors = AndroidKitFloatingSurfaceColors(
        borderColor = appColors.outlineVariant,
    ),
    componentColors = AndroidKitComponentColors(
        card = AndroidKitCardColors(borderColor = appColors.outline),
        floatingActionButton = AndroidKitFloatingActionButtonColors(
            surfaceColors = AndroidKitFloatingSurfaceColors(
                containerColor = appColors.tertiary,
                contentColor = appColors.onTertiary,
            ),
        ),
    ),
)
AndroidKitTheme(definition) {
    AndroidKitCard(
        title = title,
        colors = AndroidKitCardColors(containerColor = appColors.surfaceContainerLow),
    ) {
        Text(body)
    }
}
```

Color groups contain only `Color` values and nested color groups.
`Color.Unspecified` inherits the relevant component theme color, shared
floating-surface color (for floating roles), or current palette default.
Explicit instance colors take precedence. Replacing a definition's color scheme
recomputes unspecified defaults instead of retaining colors from the old scheme.
Explicit overrides remain explicit. Destructive actions retain the Kit error
color policy, and existing disabled-state color behavior remains intact.

| Component | Supported appearance inputs |
| --- | --- |
| Cards | Container, content, border, supporting-text and trailing-content colors |
| List selection | Checked fill, checked glyph and unchecked outline colors shared by List, Grid and Select all |
| Section cards and Settings | Container, content, border, divider and secondary-content colors; existing switch/slider colors |
| Pages and lock pages | Background and content-protection colors; title/button/flyout surface colors |
| Bottom sheets | Container, content, drag-handle, scrim, chrome and flyout colors |
| Floating buttons, action bars and toolbars | Surface and flyout colors; toolbar separator color |
| Navigation | Containers, selected/unselected content and indicators, disabled colors, drawer badges and overflow surfaces |
| Search fields, tooltips and other floating controls | Shared palette and floating-surface colors |

Floating-surface roles include container, content, border, shadow and disabled
colors. Component colors inherit from the palette unless explicitly overridden.

Container alpha for floating surfaces follows `floatingSurfaceOpacityLevel`,
including surfaces with an explicit container color. Keep the existing persisted
0–100 setting; this migration does not change its range or opacity mapping.

## Reading shared scales

`AndroidKitThemeTokens.typography`, `shapes` and `dimensions` remain readable for
app-owned content. Dimensions have an internal constructor and no copy operation.
Neither a theme definition nor a component can accept replacement scales.

Hosts can use their own Material theme for application bodies. Kit chrome and
controls establish a separate Material theme boundary with Kit typography and
shapes; pages, cards, sheets, navigation and search results preserve host-owned
body content. Surface content colors continue to flow into their bodies.

## Migrating from 0.1.50-SNAPSHOT

This is a source and binary breaking change in `0.1.51-SNAPSHOT`.

| Former input | Replacement |
| --- | --- |
| Theme `typography`, `shapes`, `dimensions` | Remove; use host Material themes and read-only tokens for app bodies |
| Theme component `*Style` | Corresponding group in `componentColors` |
| Theme `floatingSurfaceStyle` | Definition `floatingSurfaceColors` |
| Component `style` | Color-only `colors` |
| Page `titleBarStyle` | `titleBarColors` |
| List page `supportCardStyle` | `supportCardColors` |
| Floating action `Button` / `Bar` `style` | Color-only `colors` |
| Theme `settingSectionStyle` colors | `componentColors.sectionCard` |
| Card padding/spacing, toolbar padding/item spacing | Remove; Kit supplies geometry |
| Page/sheet floating-action margin | Remove; retain supported alignment |
| Sheet body/chrome padding and chrome-content spacing | Remove; apply the returned managed padding once |
| Border width, elevation, shape, typography and shadow dimensions | Remove; Kit supplies defaults |

Outer modifiers, app-list padding/arrangement, window insets, menu
placement/offset/anchor, sheet sizing/fit, chrome visibility and typed action
layout choices remain supported. Existing switch/slider color options and explicit
tints remain color-only inputs. There are no compatibility style overloads.

## Selection and card indicators

Use componentColors.listSelection to configure AndroidKitListSelectionColors.
checkedContainerColor controls the filled checked circle, checkedContentColor
controls its checkmark, and uncheckedContentColor controls the empty outline.
Unspecified colors follow primary, onPrimary and onSurface respectively. List
items, Grid items and the Select all pill use the same indicator.

AndroidKitCard accepts optional, visual-only trailingContent. The card reserves
space beside its title, supporting text and body and follows layout direction.
The slot inherits card.trailingContentColor through LocalContentColor; an
instance color overrides the theme color. Unspecified inherits the card's
content color. The host owns the indicator's meaning, state, localized
description and actions. Pin persistence and pinned-first ordering stay in the
host.
